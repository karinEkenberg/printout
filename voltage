        /*Calculating the time to charge a car pseudocode

          Step 1: Declaring all the constants, these will not change value.
          CURRENT_123 = 123;
          VOLTAGE_456 = 456;
          CAPACITY_789 = 789;

          Step 2: Declaring variables for charging power, these values will change when the program is run.
          chargPower1 = 0;

          Step 3: Declaring variables for charging time, these values will change when the program is run.
          chargTime1 = 0.0;

          Step 4: Managing the number of decimals when using floating numbers.
          int nrOfDeci = 2;
          double scale = 0;
          scale = Math.pow (10, nrOfDeci);

          Step 5: Calculating the chargingpower by multiplying the current 
          with voltage and then divide it by 1000.
          chargPower1 = (CURRENT_123 * VOLTAGE_456)/ 1000;
          
          Step 6: Calculating the charging time by dividing capacity with chargingpower.
          chargeTime1 = CAPACITY_789/chargPower1;

          Step 7: Printing out the table by using the printline statement for a normal comment and then using 
          the printf statement with formatted data.
          output("Info about battery charging time");
          output("Current, Voltage, Charging power, Charging time");
